Building UIs are getting a little more easier. I also introduced written Wireframes

It helps in making websites and breaking them down to the bare minimum

I am making a plan to build HTML in the mornings then CSS at night

I think like with everything, I have to find my Coding Groove

4 days staying consistant with code. I am not building "sites" per say but I am at least coding..
